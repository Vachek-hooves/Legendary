    article: "The 1986 World Cup in Mexico witnessed one of the most controversial moments in football history — Diego Maradona's infamous \"Hand of God\" goal. This event occurred during the quarterfinal match between Argentina and England, a game that was already charged with political and emotional tension due to the Falklands War, which had taken place just four years earlier.\n\nIn the 51st minute, Maradona, known for his extraordinary skill and vision, jumped to challenge England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton for the ball. As the ball soared through the air, Maradona raised his left hand and punched the ball into the net. To the shock of England's players and fans, the referee allowed the goal to stand, unaware of the handball violation. Maradona cheekily remarked later that the goal was scored \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God.\"\n\nJust four minutes after this controversial goal, Maradona scored what is often called the \"Goal of the Century\" — a brilliant solo run from midfield, beating half of the English team before slotting the ball past Shilton. His second goal cemented Argentina's 2-1 victory and moved them into the semifinals, eventually leading to their World Cup triumph.\n\nThe \"Hand of God\" remains a symbol of Maradona's dual nature — an artist of the game, capable of both dazzling skill and bending the rules. This moment sparked debates about sportsmanship and integrity, but it also added to Maradona's legendary status in football lore, where he is revered as one of the greatest players of all time.",

    article: "At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, American high jumper Dick Fosbury revolutionized his sport with a technique that would come to be known as the 'Fosbury Flop.' On October 20, 1968, Fosbury used his innovative backwards jumping style to clear 2.24 meters (7 feet 4¼ inches), setting an Olympic record and winning the gold medal.\n\nFosbury's technique was a radical departure from the traditional straddle or scissors methods used by high jumpers at the time. Instead of approaching the bar face-first, Fosbury turned his back to the bar at the last moment, arched his back over it, and kicked his legs up to clear the bar. This technique allowed him to get his center of gravity lower than the bar while jumping, enabling him to clear greater heights.\n\nInitially met with skepticism and even ridicule, Fosbury's method proved its effectiveness on the world's biggest stage. His Olympic victory not only earned him a gold medal but also changed the face of high jumping forever. Within a few years, the 'Fosbury Flop' became the standard technique used by high jumpers worldwide, demonstrating how innovation can dramatically transform a sport.",
    moreDetail: "Dick Fosbury's journey to Olympic gold and revolutionizing the high jump began years earlier when he started experimenting with his unique jumping style in high school. Frustrated with his lack of success using traditional techniques, Fosbury began to develop his backwards jumping method, refining it through trial and error.\n\nPreparing for the 1968 Olympics, Fosbury faced skepticism from coaches and fellow athletes who doubted the effectiveness and safety of his technique. However, he remained committed to his method, focusing on perfecting his approach and timing.\n\nAt the Olympics, Fosbury had to contend not just with his competitors but also with the high altitude of Mexico City, which affected many athletes' performances. Despite these challenges, he remained focused and confident in his unorthodox technique.\n\nThe impact of Fosbury's innovation was immediate and long-lasting. His gold medal performance silenced critics and sparked a revolution in high jumping. Within a decade, the majority of world-class high jumpers had adopted the 'Fosbury Flop,' and it remains the standard technique to this day.\n\nBeyond high jumping, Fosbury's success became a symbol of the power of innovation and thinking outside the box. His willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and perfect a new technique demonstrated how creativity could lead to breakthrough performances in sports. The 'Fosbury Flop' stands as one of the most significant technical innovations in the history of track and field, cementing Dick Fosbury's place as a true pioneer in athletics."
