    article: "The 1986 World Cup in Mexico witnessed one of the most controversial moments in football history — Diego Maradona's infamous \"Hand of God\" goal. This event occurred during the quarterfinal match between Argentina and England, a game that was already charged with political and emotional tension due to the Falklands War, which had taken place just four years earlier.\n\nIn the 51st minute, Maradona, known for his extraordinary skill and vision, jumped to challenge England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton for the ball. As the ball soared through the air, Maradona raised his left hand and punched the ball into the net. To the shock of England's players and fans, the referee allowed the goal to stand, unaware of the handball violation. Maradona cheekily remarked later that the goal was scored \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God.\"\n\nJust four minutes after this controversial goal, Maradona scored what is often called the \"Goal of the Century\" — a brilliant solo run from midfield, beating half of the English team before slotting the ball past Shilton. His second goal cemented Argentina's 2-1 victory and moved them into the semifinals, eventually leading to their World Cup triumph.\n\nThe \"Hand of God\" remains a symbol of Maradona's dual nature — an artist of the game, capable of both dazzling skill and bending the rules. This moment sparked debates about sportsmanship and integrity, but it also added to Maradona's legendary status in football lore, where he is revered as one of the greatest players of all time.",
